# Calorie-Counter
Calorie Counter made in python

# Features
- Multiple users by creating seperate directories and file for a user
- Insert calories by date
- View a table of the items and the total calories for that day

# Working on
- Be able to store frequent item so you wouldn't need to input the calories just the item and its amount
- Storing the total calories in another file and graphing it
- Storing the total calories per item for that date and graphing it

# Future Features I am thinking about
- Being able to add your weight and see its correlation with how much calories you consume
- Add a little ML so that with enough information with the amount of calories you eat and your weight to predict what your weight in the future might be

# Problems
- The main problem is that you can only input data to the current month only
- There is also a problem where the function that I use to get the time has it so that a single digit date is stored with a zero. So when you input a date that in single digit you would have to write it with a 0 so if that date is the 2nd you would have to write it as 02.

- I am new to coding in python so if you find any major mistakes or you have any suggestions on how to improve this please let me know.
