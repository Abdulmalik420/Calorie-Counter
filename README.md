# Calorie-Counter
Calorie Counter made in python

# Features
- Multiple users by creating seperate directories and file for a user
- Insert calories by date
- View a table of the items and the total calories for that day

# Working on
- Be able to store frequent item so you wouldn't need to input the calories just the item and its amount
- Storing the total calories in another file and graphing it
- Storing the total calories per item for that date and graphing it

# Future Features I am thinking about
- Being able to add your weight and see its correlation with how much calories you consume
- Add a little ML so that with enough information with the amount of calories you eat and your weight to predict what your weight in the future might be
